# Mock Data Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully moved all mock data from frontend components to backend API endpoints, eliminating hardcoded data in React components.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`/backend/routes/api.js`)

#### 1. Added Flows Management
- **GET /api/flows** - Returns list of all family tree flows with metadata
- **GET /api/flows/:id** - Returns specific flow data (nodes, edges, metadata)
- **POST /api/flows/:id** - Save/update specific flow data
- **DELETE /api/flows/:id** - Delete a specific flow

#### 2. Updated Flow Data Structure
- Created `flows` array with flow metadata (id, name, description, counts, timestamps)
- Created `flowsData` object with complete flow data including nodes and edges
- Maintained `defaultFlowData` for the AddFlow component

#### 3. Sample Data Added
- **Smith Family Tree** (Flow ID: 1) - 4 people with spouse and parent relationships
- **Johnson Heritage** (Flow ID: 2) - 4 people with multi-generational family
- **Garcia Ancestry** (Flow ID: 3) - 6 people with extended Spanish/Mexican family tree

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. FlowList Component (`/frontend/src/pages/FlowList.js`)
- **Before**: Used hardcoded `mockFlows` array in component
- **After**: Fetches flows from `GET /api/flows`
- **Features**: Loading states, error handling, API-driven delete functionality

#### 2. EditFlow Component (`/frontend/src/pages/EditFlow.js`)
- **Before**: Used hardcoded `mockFlowData` object with inline family data
- **After**: Fetches specific flow data from `GET /api/flows/:id`
- **Features**: API-driven loading, saving to `POST /api/flows/:id`
- **Cleanup**: Removed unused `RELATIONSHIP_TYPES` import

### API Integration Points

#### Flow List Page
```javascript
// Before
const mockFlows = [/* hardcoded data */];

// After
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/flows');
const result = await response.json();
setFlows(result.data);
```

#### Edit Flow Page
```javascript
// Before
const mockFlowData = { '1': {/* hardcoded data */} };

// After
const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3001/api/flows/${id}`);
const result = await response.json();
setNodes(result.data.nodes);
setEdges(result.data.edges);
```

#### Save Flow
```javascript
// Before
// Simulate API call with setTimeout

// After
const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:3001/api/flows/${id}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ name, description, nodes, edges })
});
```

## Data Flow Architecture

### Before
```
Frontend Components → Hardcoded Mock Data → Component State
```

### After
```
Frontend Components → API Calls → Backend Mock Data → Component State
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Centralized Data Management**: All family tree data now managed in backend
2. **Consistent Data Source**: Frontend and backend share same data structure
3. **Scalability**: Easy to replace backend mock data with real database
4. **API-First Design**: Clean separation between frontend and backend
5. **Error Handling**: Proper loading states and error handling for API calls

## API Endpoints Summary

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/flows` | GET | Get all flows list |
| `/api/flows/:id` | GET | Get specific flow data |
| `/api/flows/:id` | POST | Save/update flow data |
| `/api/flows/:id` | DELETE | Delete a flow |
| `/api/flow` | GET | Get default flow data (for AddFlow) |

## Testing Results

✅ Backend API endpoints working correctly
✅ Frontend loading flows from API
✅ Edit flow loading specific flow data from API
✅ Save functionality using API
✅ Delete functionality using API
✅ Error handling and loading states implemented
✅ No hardcoded mock data remaining in frontend

All mock data has been successfully migrated to the backend API with proper error handling and loading states throughout the application.
